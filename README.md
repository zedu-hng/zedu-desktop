# Zedu Desktop

A lean Flutter app using Clean Architecture, Material 3, and Riverpod. The codebase is organized for desktop and mobile targets, with an **auth** feature (login, session, and API wiring) as the reference vertical slice.

## Stack

- Flutter 3.x / Dart `^3.11`
- Material 3, Roboto and Lato fonts (see `pubspec.yaml`)
- Riverpod, GetIt, GoRouter
- Dio, `flutter_dotenv`
- `flutter_secure_storage`, `flutter_svg`
- Mocktail (tests), `flutter_lints` plus strict analyzer language flags in `analysis_options.yaml`

## Architecture

Each feature owns its UI, business rules, repository contract, and data implementation.

```txt
presentation -> domain <- data
```

- `app`: bootstrap and root `MaterialApp.router`.
- `core`: shared infrastructure (DI, HTTP, env, routing, theme, secure storage).
- `features`: vertical modules; today this is **`auth`** (login flow and session models).

Example flow:

```txt
LoginView
  -> auth providers (Riverpod)
  -> AuthRepository
  -> AuthRemoteDataSource
  -> ApiBaseService
```

## Core rules

Keep `core` small. Add shared code only when more than one feature needs it.

Good `core` candidates: app config, dependency injection, API client and failures, navigation, secure storage, logging, theme, and cross-cutting utilities.

## Barrel exports

Every folder that exposes reusable Dart files should have a barrel file.

Use **exactly these two root-barrel imports** when you need shared core plus feature exports (same order and URIs as `lib/features/auth/data/datasource/auth_remote_datasource.dart`):

```dart
import 'package:zedu/core/core.dart';
import 'package:zedu/features/features.dart';
```

If you rename the app in `pubspec.yaml`, update the `package:` name in both lines to match.

Export chain:

```txt
leaf files -> layer barrel -> feature barrel -> features.dart
shared core files -> core.dart
```

Rules:

- Add new exports whenever you add a reusable file.
- Prefer `core/core.dart` for shared app infrastructure.
- Prefer `features/features.dart` when code needs feature-level exports.
- Inside a feature, use the narrowest useful barrel when `features.dart` would create an import cycle—often a **layer** barrel (`data/data.dart`, `domain/domain.dart`, `presentation/presentation.dart`) or a **subfolder** barrel.

**Narrower than `features.dart`:** import that feature’s barrel first, e.g. `lib/features/auth/auth.dart`. Reach for layer or subfolder barrels only when you need a smaller slice to break a cycle or keep dependencies obvious.

## Configuration

Env keys are read from **dotenv** after `loadAppEnv()` in `main.dart`. The repo bundles the tracked **`.env.example`** as a Flutter asset, so a fresh clone builds and runs without creating a local `.env`. `loadAppEnv()` still prefers `.env` when it is present in the asset bundle, then falls back to `.env.example`.

1. Edit `.env.example` for values that should ship with the repo.
2. Prefer CI variables or `--dart-define` for local or production overrides (avoid committing secrets).
3. If you need a local `.env`, add it back to `flutter.assets` in `pubspec.yaml`; it then takes precedence over `.env.example`.

```txt
API_BASE_URL=https://api.staging.zedu.chat/api/v1/
USE_MOCK_DATA=false
```

`USE_MOCK_DATA` accepts `true` / `false` (also `1` / `0`, `yes` / `no`).

### Overrides for CI or release builds

`--dart-define` overrides dotenv when you need non-file config:

```sh
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com --dart-define=USE_MOCK_DATA=false
```

Defaults when neither `.env` / `.env.example` nor defines set a value (see `AppConfig.fromEnvironment`):

```txt
API_BASE_URL=https://api.staging.zedu.chat/api/v1/
USE_MOCK_DATA=false
```

## Clone

The repository root **is** the Flutter project (`pubspec.yaml` and `lib/` at the top level).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hngprojects/zedu-desktop.git
cd zedu-desktop
```

## Quick start

A fresh clone needs no env file: the tracked `.env.example` is bundled automatically.

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

For local overrides, pass `--dart-define` values (see [Overrides for CI or release builds](#overrides-for-ci-or-release-builds)).

## Running on Windows(locally)

On Windows, run the app with one command from the repository root, in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\run_windows.ps1
```

The script works on a fresh clone and on an existing setup. It checks the current state at every step and skips, repairs or redoes its work, including the Agora SDK fix in your Pub cache, so you do not need any manual steps first. The first run downloads the large Agora SDKs and takes a while. If PowerShell blocks scripts, run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\run_windows.ps1`. Use `.\run_windows.ps1 build` for a debug build and `.\run_windows.ps1 --release` for release. It needs Flutter, Visual Studio with Desktop development with C++, and Windows Developer Mode. The full guide, with a manual fallback, is in [`windows-setup-locally.md`](windows-setup-locally.md).

Tested with Flutter 3.47.7 and Visual Studio 2026 Community (Desktop development with C++). Run every command in PowerShell, do not run Flutter as administrator, and never commit or share your `.env` file.

The script handles these build errors, and the guide explains each one:

- `Cannot extract through symlink` from the Agora plugin
- `No file or variants found for asset: .env`
- `error STL1011` in `audioplayers_windows`
- `file cannot create directory: C:/Program Files/zedu` during install
- `Cannot open include file: 'AgoraMediaBase.h'` when the clone path is too long
- `Cannot open source file ... cpp_client_wrapper\core_implementations.cc` after a build from a long path
- `Failed to install nuget package Microsoft.Windows.ImplementationLibrary` when `api.nuget.org` is unreachable


## Common commands

```sh
dart format lib test
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Use `flutter analyze` for this project so the Flutter SDK and bundled assets resolve correctly.

## Testing

Tests mirror the app layout:

- `test/helpers`: reusable test setup (e.g. `TestMaterialApp`)
- `test/unit`: datasources, repositories, and services
- `test/widget`: views and important UI flows

Mock dependencies at the layer boundary being tested.

### Billing credit balance

Open **Billing & Plans** to see the organization's AI credit balance. Billing
and the user menu use the same balance provider: a loaded balance of `0` is
displayed as zero rather than replaced with the cached account balance. The
existing cached-account fallback remains in use during initial loading and in
the error state.

The regression tests keep a cached balance of `100`, then load `0` or `25`
through the credits notifier and check that Billing and the user menu agree:

```sh
flutter test test/widget/features/credits/presentation/views/buy_credits_view_test.dart
```

## Windows installer (MSIX)

`windows/packaging/` builds Zedu Desktop as an MSIX package and tests it on a clean VM. Run the scripts from the repo root in PowerShell (Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7). A `Get-Item : Could not find item ...\AppData` line during the build comes from a plugin's symlink resolver (`super_native_extensions`) and is harmless.

**Requirements:**
- Flutter.
- Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++", including **C++ ATL**.
- The Windows 10/11 SDK, for `makeappx.exe` and `signtool.exe`.
- A local `.env` (`Copy-Item .env.example .env`). Its values are bundled into the package, so keep it free of secrets.

### Build a package

```powershell
.\windows\packaging\package_msix.ps1 -Sign
```

This runs `flutter build windows --release`, stages the Release folder together with the MSVC runtime, fills in `windows/packaging/AppxManifest.template.xml` and packs `build\msix\Zedu_<version>.msix`.
- **Version:** taken from `pubspec.yaml` (`0.1.0+1` becomes `0.1.0.0`). Use `-Version` to override it.
- **`-SkipBuild`:** reuses the last release build.
- **`-VsInstance`:** pins CMake to a Visual Studio install. Use it if several are installed and the build fails with `atlstr.h` not found.

The manifest declares the `zedu://` protocol and the microphone and webcam capabilities used for voice notes and calls. Tile and splash images live in `windows/packaging/Assets`. Regenerate them after an app icon change with `windows\packaging\make_msix_logos.ps1`.

### Test signing and installing

`-Sign` signs with a self-signed certificate, `CN=Zedu Desktop Test`, created once in your `CurrentUser\My` store. It also writes `build\msix\zedu_test.cer`. To install on a test machine, run an admin PowerShell:

```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath zedu_test.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople
Add-AppxPackage -Path Zedu_0.1.0.0.msix
```

Store builds use the Partner Center identity (`-IdentityName`, `-Publisher`) and are uploaded **unsigned**.

### Clean-VM test

`vm_test_msix.ps1` reverts a VMware Workstation VM to a snapshot, then:
1. copies in the package and certificate, and trusts the certificate;
2. installs the package and checks the Start menu entry;
3. launches the app, then opens a `zedu://` link;
4. checks the event log for `zedu.exe` errors, uninstalls, and reverts.

```powershell
$env:ZEDU_VM_GUEST_PASSWORD = '<guest login>'
$env:ZEDU_VM_PASSWORD = '<VM encryption password, Windows 11 + vTPM only>'
.\windows\packaging\vm_test_msix.ps1 -VmxPath "E:\VMs\Win11\Windows 11 x64.vmx" -SnapshotName "Clean Base" -GuestUser tester
```

Take the snapshot with that guest user (an administrator) signed in at the desktop. Logs, screenshots and `summary.txt` go to `build\msix\vm-test\<timestamp>\`, and the script exits with code 1 if any check fails.
